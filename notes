important notations for machine learning:

h = hypothesis
m = number of training examples
x = input variable/features
y = output variable/target variable
(x,y) = one training example
(x (i), y (i)) = i-th training example (i is superscript)
:= assignment
= truth assertion
α learning rate
“𝛛” means partial derivative
“𝓭” means derivative

Hypothesis:
h 𝛉(x) = 𝛉0 + 𝛉1 x

Parameters:
𝛉0, 𝛉1

Cost Function:
J(𝛉0, 𝛉1) = 1/2m ∑ (i=1 to m) (h 𝛉(x^(i)) - y^(i))^2

Goal:
minimize J(𝛉0, 𝛉1)
over 𝛉0, 𝛉1

The first hypothesis is given as:

h 𝛉(x) = 𝛉1 x
𝛉0 = 0
for fixed 𝛉1, this is a function of x

Derivative: The slope of the line that is tangent to the function at certain point

𝛉1 := 𝛉1 - α(𝓭/𝓭𝛉1)J(𝛉1)
where alpha is the learning rate

When the slope has a positive value:

The derivative takes a positive value
𝛉1 := 𝛉1 - α(positive number)
We are going to decrease 𝛉1 to get closer to the minimum.

When the slope has a negative value:

The derivate is negative
𝛉1 := 𝛉1 - α(negative number)

When α is too small, gradient descent can be slow:
𝛉1 := 𝛉1 - α(𝓭/𝓭𝛉1)J(𝛉1)
When α is small, the derivative multiplies with a small number

When α is too large, gradient descent can overshoot the minimum:
𝛉1 := 𝛉1 - α(𝓭/𝓭𝛉1)J(𝛉1)
If 𝛉 is close to the minimum and α is too big, it can fail to converge or diverge.
